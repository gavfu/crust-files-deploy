Any newly registered Premium User has a chance to win the prize pool if he/she meets the winning conditions:  </p><p><strong>The last Premium User to join before the countdown reaches zero is the winner of the current pool. Any newcomer will refresh the countdown timer to 30 minutes and add 0.4 CRU to the prize pool.</strong>  </p><p>The size of prize pool will continue to grow if: 1) No one meets the winning condition, and 2) before it reaches the cap. The cap is currently set to be 100,000 CRU. When the cap is reached, the prize will be moved to the GRAND DRAW pool.</p><h3>How to play</h3><p>Any new Premium User has a chance to win the current prize pool!  </p><p>Registering a Premium User in Crust Files will generate an <strong>on-chain transaction</strong> that records the registration information. This transaction would be the ONLY valid identifier to a Premium User&#x27;s identity, and the ONLY basis for determining the winner in the LUCKY NEWBIE game (as well in the other two Reward Programs!).  </p><p>Similarly, the timer in this game counts time according to the <strong>block height</strong> on Crust&#x27;s blockchain, which produces a block every 6 seconds - 30 minutes = 300 blocks passed on-chain.  </p><h2>GRAND DRAW - detailed rules</h2><h3>Basics</h3><p>This is a lucky draw game.  </p><p>The draw will be held each time Premium Users total a certain number. The prize pool will grow bigger as we reach further milestones.  </p><p>As mentioned, we define a valid Premium User by a specific on-chain transaction that marks his/her registration. We then take the <strong>tx hash</strong> of this transaction as one&#x27;s permanent <strong>Draw Ticket</strong>. Every Premium User will find his or her Drawing Ticket on the Share-and-Earn page.  </p><h3>How to play</h3><ol><li>Wait till the pool gets unlocked  </li></ol><p>The pool of each season will get unlocked (open for signing up) each time a new milestone is reached. Keep an eye on the progress before unlock!  </p><ol start="2"><li>Sign up for the draw  </li></ol><p>You will have 3 days to sign up after the pool is unlocked. Click the &#x27;Sign Up&#x27; button before the due date if you want to participate in the draw.  </p><ol start="3"><li>The draw result  </li></ol><p>In the sign up stage, a future block will be decided (by block height) to be the &#x27;Draw Block&#x27;. The winners will be those whose &#x27;Drawing Ticket&#x27; share the same last n (n could be 1, 2, or 3, should be pre-determined) digits with the &#x27;Draw Block&#x27;.  </p><h2>Claim your rewards</h2><h3>Where are my rewards?</h3><p>Check the rewards information at:  </p><ul><li>&#x27;My Rewards&#x27; section on the Share-and-Earn page.</li><li>Profile Info Card in the upper-right corner.</li></ul><p>Both will display your rewards.   </p><h3>How to claim my rewards?</h3><p>Go to the &#x27;My Rewards&#x27; section on the Share-and-Earn Page, and find the <strong>Claim</strong> button.</p><p>Click the button, sign the claim request transaction (which is an on-chain transaction on Crust Network).
